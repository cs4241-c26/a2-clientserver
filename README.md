## Workout Logger

https://a2-sstardellis.glitch.me/

This web application is a simple way to log and store workout information. Once you complete a workout at the gym, you can log it using the form and be able to see it at the bottom half of the page.
This will help you keep track of your workouts by writing down what muscle group, the date, the number of exercises, the intensity, and any comments.
The form takes in four fields, and the app uses flexbox for a layout of our two big components. The color scheme is a plain white background with various other shades of white for layering the website.
The button for submission is green and the button to delete data from the table is red.

In order to use the application, first complete a workout in the gym. Afterward, start selecting your muscle group that you worked out. Next, select the number of exercises completed during the workout.
Next, select the date of the workout and add any comments for that workout/day. Lastly, press submit and the form will appear at the bottom half of the page. You can delete entries by pressing the delete button.

## Technical Achievements (5 points)
- **Tech Achievement 1**: By combining the form submission and the result into one page, it makes way easier to stay put on one page rather than moving around to see your results or history of workouts.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements (10 points, reviewed by 2 people)
- **Design Achievement 1**:

- Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
  Walden and Schechter.

- What problems did the user have with your design?
  Both users thought the design was simple and easy to navigate through but one thing that was mentioned was the results table.
  They believed that the results table interface can be improved a little bit such as fixing the delete button placement and overall coloring/design.

- What comments did they make that surprised you?
  One of them mentioned that they really liked the implementation of the calendar function for filling in the field, making it
  easier to log information rather than typing the date. Additionally, they both noticed the blue shadow behind the form, which they liked.

- What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
  Based on their feedback, I would make changes to the table, as I do believe it can be improved visually. One suggestion other than this was that
  adding a streak system might be nice to see how long a person logging their workouts and keep going.
