## Web Application Title: Task List
My project keeps track of tasks, including task names, priorities, due dates, and whether they are overdue. Tasks can 
be created using the "Create New Task" form on the left, can be viewed in the "My Tasks" table on the right, and deleted
from the "My Tasks" table on the right.

CSS positioning technique used: flexbox, which is used to split the main content into two even columns, and also at the 
footer to evenly space the content.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: single-page application.
  - Each time users submit or delete data, the server responds with the current state of the server-side data. 
  - The user doesn't need to refresh the page to see the changes they make to the data. They can see it automatically after clicking "submit" or "delete".
- **Tech Achievement 2**: editing data.
  - The user is able to modify the name, priority, and due date of each task listed in the table.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement**: testing UI/UX design with a classmate.
  - Provide the name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.

  - What problems did the user have with your design?
    - The footer appears in the middle of the page when the task list is short.
  - What comments did they make that surprised you?
    - The color scheme made it easy to follow along and keep track of tasks.
    - The font styles looked good but weren't too distracting.
  - What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
    - Making the footer stick to the bottom of the screen.
    - Adding more spacing between elements to make the website more visually appealing and to make it easier to read the task list.
