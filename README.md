## Ariel Schechter a2-shortstack: Todo App [Glitch link](https://a2-aschechter10.glitch.me/)

User 1: James Walden

Feedback: The single page app design works well for this context but without labels, it may not be clear what the buttons do and may not be accessible. 

Integrated?: Yes, I added a title attribute to both the add a new task button and to the delete buttons to help the user understand what to do if it isn't clear.

Feedback: App looks great! Very intuitive and easy to use. Only feedback is maybe make the add button a little bigger since it can be a little hard to find on the bottom right of the page. I 
like the mobile first approach though!

Integrated?: Yes, I doubled the size of the button to make it a more prominent feature on the page.
