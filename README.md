## a2-jdwalden74 Homework Tracker
My applications functions as a homework tracker allowing you to add homework assignments you need to complete with some 
additional data, and also calculates how many days you have until it is due. Start by adding a homework assignment
by clicking the button on the top right and fill out the form. Feel free to edit or delete any Previous entries. I used, class,
id, and element selectors in a CSS file to style the website featuring a simply animation on the banner, styling for
the form and table, and also with some javascript allows for the toggling of the a visible or hidden form. Another 
feature worth mentioning is that the server updates the current date when you load the application, so the time left
will actually update day to day and not just form the day you created it.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Using a combination of javascript on the client and server side created a dynamic table that
- updates upon every insert, update, or deletion to the server side data so you always have an accurate view of the data.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Edit functionality for individual entries is present
- 

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Gus Montana:
- 1) Gus found that a lot of the screen was white space without any styling and thought the table should be expanded
      and additional styling should be included. 
2) He commented that the priorty field didnt seem that useful since you already include how long each one should take.
3) I should have added more styling to the table to make it more visually appealing. 

- **Design Achievement 2**: Ariel Schecter:
1) Ari found that having to repeatedly click the add assignment button was tedious and not very useful with so much
open space on the screen.
2) It didn't really surprise me but it was still notable that the edit functionality was somewhat flawed, since there
is no unique identifier and only using title can lead to some errors editing the wrong data point when editing.
3) I would maybe consider adding the form above the table permanently so that you wouldn't need to hit any buttons to add
data to the table.
