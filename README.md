# 1 Rep Max Calcuator 

I created a single page app that allows the user to add data about their lifts and then calculates their projected max(the derived data). The styling is simple, displaying a tablke in the middle of the screeen with a short description of how to use the app. I used flexbox to align my page. I used all three class, id, and element styling throughout and specifically with my button components.

## Technical Achievements

### Technical Achievement 1

My app is a single page solution that has a form to submit data and allows users to add a type of exercise with a reps and weight. It does this in real time. It also allows the user to remove a lift using the X button. The server also sends back the derived data which is the projected max of the users lift. It does this logic on the server side.

### Technical Achievement 2

As mentioned above the user can add and delete data from the table. The user can also modify the reps and weight and this will update the derieved data which is the projected max in real time.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements

### Design Achievement 1

I had Benson Lin give me some feedback. He said that I should include blinking cursur on the selected box which was definitely fair, and that is something I would change. He surprised me by saying that he could not modify the exercises, this ccan be done, but removing the cursor was definitely a mistake that makes it harder to see

I also had Zoe Fisk take a look at my design. She said similar things to Benson, she said that I should add hover animation over the text box that is selected, and that is something I would implement if I could do it again. She surprised me with the same thing as Benson. It was not clear that the text boxes were editable, this is something that I should make more clear to the user if I were to do it again.
